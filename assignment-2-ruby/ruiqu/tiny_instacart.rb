# TODO

# orders, drivers, batches, order_items, payments

# Compose a simple terminal program using one or more of the common objects from Instacart (orders, drivers, batches, order_items, payments, etc)

# Design a desired workflow. ex. The entire flow of a driver from accepting a batch to delivery
# Using the tools and concepts from the completed room cleaner program, construct a self-running terminal program that successfully runs through your intended workflow.
# Test your program thoroughly to ensure that it runs as expected.
# Possible Extensions:

# Ruby offers alternatives to if/else including unless, while, and until.
# Set parameters for your program through user input
# Make sure to incorporate if/else and the appropriate operators.
# Look up how to use a ruby hash to create an array with multiple attributes per array element and run an each loop that checks the values of said attributes. ex. (`drivers = [{name: "Rose", role: "in-store-shopper"}, {name: "Donna", role: "shift-lead"}, {name: "Amelia Pond", role: "full-service"}, {name: "Martha Jones", role: "cashier"})
